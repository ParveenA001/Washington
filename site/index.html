            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate computer engineering student studying at George Washington University. I am focusing on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing. I fell in love with architecture, processors, and speed when I took the first architecture course in my undergrad and knew thats what I wanted to pursue. If you want to contact me you can do so by emailing me on my school email or sending me a message.</p>
