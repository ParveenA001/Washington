    <h2>Who I am:</h2>
    <h5>A little look into who I am and where I am today</h5>
    
    <p>I am a graduate computer engineering student at George Washington University. My area of focus is Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing.</p>
    <p>I am an active person in my field, conducting research, working on projects and constantly trying to improve myself with the technology around me. I am what you would call a gamer as well, from computer games, to Table Top RPGS, to board games, I enjoy all of it. I am currently trying to also become a more active and health conscious person. But one thing is for sure, I am a hardworking student that just wants change. I hope to be able to take stpes to get that change and truly push the limits as we know it.</p>
    <h2>What I Know About Architecture:</h2>
    <h5>Part 2 of assignment</h5>
    <p>Computer architecture is like the building blocks that connect everything together. It brings software and hardware together in a magical way. If I were to explain it in its simplest form, its how we connect all the lego pieces together. If we also look at kind of the stack of how everything works, computer architecture is sat right in the middle of everything. You want to make sure that you can perform specific applications on a device? You need the right architecture.</p>
    <p>I think that architecture will continue blooming for generations to come. Its not a field that will fall off, no matter what is thrown its way, that is because we always need stronger and more powerful computers. I see the field growing in a sense where we can create faster, smarter, smaller, and AI based computer everywhere. Truly giving Architects that shine that no one else can take from us. Computers will become stronger and more enrgy efficient and we as architects will always have a place in the workforce.</p>
